# Tritium
Tritium is a Halo: Combat Evolved cache file rebuilder written in Rust. It's capable of disassociating tags from map files to make them much easier to manage, then reassembling the map file. It also provides functions for removing and inserting tags, as well.

To use in your project, clone this repository and add this to your project's cargo.toml file:
```toml
[dependencies.tritium]
path = "path/to/tritium"
```
